# TODO: create class Student, following the syntax of the example
# model I gave you. It should have a name, year (junior, senior, etc.)
# id, and concentration. For now, these will all be strings (except the id)
# pay attention to how SQL creates IDs in the example. You can set the string
# length to be whatever you like.
